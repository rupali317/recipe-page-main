## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Allows to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

### Tested with

- Browsers used for testing: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, Microsoft Edge.
- Devices:
  - (Real) MacBook Pro (14-inch), Samsung Galaxy A33 5G, Samsung Galaxy S20+, iPad Air (13-inch), MacBook Pro (13-inch).
  - (Virtual) The mobile and tablet devices mentioned under Chrome's dev console.
- Screen reader: MacOS VoiceOver.

### What I learned

- I faced a dilemma where for the heading of the pink section had a different styling than the rest of `<h2>`. I had to choose if I should use `<h2>` or if I should use `<div role="heading" aria-level="2">`. Using `<h2>` meant I had to use a customised styling for it since it was different from other `<h2>` and normally the expectation is that the look and feel of the heading level should be consistent according to a test from accessibility insights. Using the `<div>` version could have passed the particular test related to consistent styling for headings. Ultimately, I decided to use `<h2>` and added a customised styling for it since it is a better option for accessibility than a using a `<div>`.

- The `::marker` is not a child of the list elemnent. It is just a part of how the browser renders the list item. Therefore, adding a `display:flex` on the list item will not turn the `::marker` into a flex-item. In fact, it disappears.

- Center aligning the bullets and text especially for mobile view. The `::marker` does not support CSS properties like padding, margin, or position. Therefore, I applied `list-style: none` for `ul` and applied the following:

```css
li:before {
  content: "â€¢";
  font-size: x-large;
  color: var(--color-secondary-2);
}
```

## Acknowledgement

- In all my projects, I always refer to CSS reset to provide a clean/consistent slate for the CSS stylings across all the browsers. [Joshua's CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/), [Andy Bell's CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/)
